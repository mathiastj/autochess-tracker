# Auto Chess Tracker

Front end for tracking rank in the Dota 2 mod Auto Chess.

Back end is based on a now removed API and will therefore no longer update/work.
The backend was also hosted on a free heroku dyno, which has been phased out, so it no longer works at all.
The response has been hardcoded, just so the frontend still shows something.

Here's how it looks: https://mathiastj.github.io/autochess-tracker/
